# PvP 101

Exedra PvP is a game mode centered almost fully around time to first break, or the denial of that. This means building a team follows some few principles which you should have in the back of your mind when building your team. When building teams having these things in mind should help you find good functional teams.  
Also take note that you get 5 MP each time you get attacked by the enemy, and aside from Infinite Poseidon and some Brilliant Beam teams all kioku require you to be hit at least twice before they have enough MP to use their ultimate, meaning that you can usually rely on getting those 10 MP for the cost of taking a little bit of damage if needed.

## Teams

### Breaker teams

This is by far the most common setup, and probably what you should aim for and also what your opponents usually will be playing. The two key aspects to consider are: AV at battle start and AA (Action advance) on BS (Battle Skill) and break. Check your values in a PvE match, or using the [PvP Calculator](http://localhost:5173/exedra-dmg-calc/#/pvp-simulator). Your win condition is simple, if you break before you get broken you are in a winning position.

The reason breaking is so important is because breaking a Kioku applies a 25% AD (Slow / Action Delay / Opposite of AA) to the target(s) and triggers your on break effects. Notable on break effects being Pluvia☆Magica's 10 MP on break, HG (Heroic Grace)'s AA on break, and breaker A4 (Ascension 4) AA on break. Break effects trigger after any action, meaning they can be triggered multiple times as long as you don't break all enemies in the same attack.

In a situation where two teams are almost speed tied you will break the enemy when their AV is very small. However due to the AD applied to the target(s) your kioku will be able to act again before the enemies exit break as long as they can achieve over 75% AA, usually resulting in them dying before they can do anything.  
Notably if you are playing Time Stop Strike her BS will give you 20% AA, requiring you to find 55% AA elsewhere. HG and A4 4☆ breakers (Verdant Shower) give 20% and 10% AA respectively, meaning that if you manage to trigger the on break effects twice you will achieve 60% AA from these sources, resulting in a total of 80% AA while only requiring Time Stop Strike, one A4 4☆ breaker and HG on your kioku.  
Of course 5☆ A4 is 20% AA, allowing you to reach 100% AA total if played over the 4☆. Most teams play multiple breakers to achieve the quickest possible breaks, if multiple of these are A4 your team quickly builds enough AA for HG not to be required.

A basic low ascension team can look like Pluvia☆Magica A0+, Verdant Shower A4+, and Time Stop Strike A0+, Hollow Woman A0+ and a flex spots, all with HG, requiring very little investments for a legitimate team.

Any 5☆ aoe breakers can be the star of the show, and using your high ascension 5☆ aoe breakers as your primary carry is often your best team, as long as you adhere to the time to first break being your win condition, and achieve the required 75% AA.

AV at battle start is influenced by spd and AA on battle start effects, making Time Stop Strike with Flame Waltz support almost always correct, likewise with Tiro Finale after unlocking A2.

Ultra Great Big Hammer's stun can be used to extend the break of enemies if you do not have sufficient damage to kill them before they exit break.

### Attacker teams

Attacker teams (or dps teams) are teams that focus on killing the enemy before they can break you. These typically play no breakers and rather rely on killing the opponents before they can act. Examples are:  
Oracle Ray (A3+) with Brilliant Beam, Thunder Torrent and Unknown Flying Fire using an MP portrait and/or Mana Infusion++ crys.  
Ultra Great Big Hammer with Mana Infusion++ crys and MP portrait targeted by Hollow Woman.

### Defender teams

Defender teams rely on surviving the initial breaks and then killing the opponents once they exit. This usually relies on multiple A4 Defenders, most importantly Baldamente Fortissimo and Vampire Fang.

Defender focused teams can be Thunder Torrent targeting Vampire Fang in a 3 defender setup, accompanied by a healer.

Defenders can also be combined with breaker teams, usually someone who can break a team by themselves, such as Nine Phases targeted by Hollow Woman. Usually in a 2 defender setup to allow Time Stop Strike or a Healer such as Pluvia☆Clara or Glitterjoy Snow Globe to join the team.

They can also be combined with Attacker teams, such as Oracle Ray, Tiro Finale Liberation or Dark Art Dominion to quickly kill the enemies once exited break. Usually in a 2 defender setup to allow Time Stop Strike or a Healer such as Pluvia☆Clara or Glitterjoy Snow Globe to join the team.

All these are countered by debuffers, most notably Ultra Great Big Hammer.

## Extra

### Targeting

Hollow Woman targets the kioku with the highest base atk.  
Brilliant Beam targets the breaker or attacker with the lowest MP (absolute value, not percentage), or the kioku with the lowest MP if no such role is present.  
Thunder Torrent targets the breaker or attacker with the lowest AV, or the kioku with the lowest AV if no such role is present.
